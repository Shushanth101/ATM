Project Overview
XYZ Bank is a console-based banking system built using Java. It allows customers to perform various banking operations such as account registration, balance checking, withdrawals, deposits, money transfers, and PIN changes. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file handling in Java.

The system stores customer data in files, which include bank balance, transaction history (withdrawals and credits), and account information. It also integrates basic sign-in functionality and follows a user-friendly menu system.

Balance Checking: Display the current balance of the customer.
Withdrawal: Allow customers to withdraw a specified amount from their account.
Deposit: Credit a specified amount to the customer's account.
Money Transfer: Transfer funds between two customer accounts.
PIN Change: Allow customers to change their ATM debit card PIN.
Transaction History: Store and display the withdrawal and credit history for each customer.
File Storage: All customer data, including account details, balances, and transactions, are stored in external files for persistence.
